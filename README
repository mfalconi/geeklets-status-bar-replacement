arg1 can be any supprted geeklet, currently time & battery
arg2 & arg3 can be options for those geeklets as documented below

geeklets.rb options:

time:
	long: time & date in long format (Saturday, September 14 11:59 PM)
	short: time & date in short format (Sat, Sep 14 11:59 PM)
	time: reports just the time (11:59 PM)
	longdate: reports just the date in long format (see above)
	shortdate: reports just the date in short format (see above)
	string: takes a ruby strftime formatted date string
		see http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Time.html#M000298
		example: geeklets.rb time string "%A, %B %d %I:%M %p" would yeild the same
		results as geeklets.rb time long, strings with spaces must be contained
		with quotation marks.

	default behavior of time is to report long time format when there are
	no arguments given

battery:
	time: reports just the ramining time until battery is charged/full
		depending on if it is plugged in or not
	percent: reports only the % of charge in the battery as a two
			digit number
	meter: displays a text based battery meter in increments of 10
		ex: ||||||---- charge is more than 60% but less than 70%
		not very granular

	default behavior of battery is to output all 3 in the following order
		meter -> percent -> time
